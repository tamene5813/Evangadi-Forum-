            <h2>Evangadi Networks Explained</h2>
            <small>A place to grow together</small>

        </div>
        <div className="notse">
          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <h3>What is Evangadi Networks?</h3>
          <p>
            It is a network formed by people who believe in the power of
            collaboration with a common goal of nurturing one another to grow
            together.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>What are the visions of the network?</h3>
          <p>
            We can divide this into two parts: the short-term vision (three to
            five years) and the long-term vision (ten to fifteen years).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the short term, we want to stay focused on helping everyone in
            the network improve their skills and knowledge in the digital world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those with the ability to comfortably navigate the digital space
            have a disproportionately large amount of opportunities available to
            them, and those unwilling or unable to make the digital leap are
            being left behind. Individuals with digital literacy have more
            secure and higher paying jobs, have an easier time starting
            businesses, and are generally more informed of the world around
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why our first priority is to connect members of the network
            with others who can help to elevate their digital literacy. With the
            help of the right mentor, the new world of information technology
            will open up a seemingly endless avenue of opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the long term, our goal is to create a network of technologically
            savvy people who can pursue their own dreams in a competitive manner
            with the rest of the world. For example, a musician might be able to
            use the network to utilize technological platforms that can help
            with the creation of new and exciting music. Then, that music can be
            marketed and distributed with the help of those knowledgeable about
            social media and internet dissemination. Naturally, this will open
            the doors for even further collaborations, improving the musician’s
            reach even further.
          </p>
          <p>
            With today’s technology, the sky is the limit. But it all starts
            with a deep community of mentors willing to help each other reach
            the new digital frontier.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How is Evangadi Networks any different from other networks that
            believe in collaboration?
          </h3>
          <p>
            While most networks focus exclusively on growing the largest network
            possible, Evangadi Networks strongly believes in the power of
            cultivating deeper, more meaningful connections between members. A
            deeper community can have far more impact than a wider one, and that
            belief is what sets us apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than create a situation where one leader mentors an entire
            group, we prefer to create more meaningful, one-on-one relationships
            that leave the opportunity open for greater depth and impact. For
            example, instead of putting a 1st grader in a group of peers to be
            mentored by a single leader, we find a 3rd grader to enter into an
            individual mentoring relationship with the student. This deepens the
            mentor/mentee relationship and enriches both students in the
            process.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Who can be a part of this network?</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone who believes in the power of collaboration can join the
            network; the only requirement is the understanding that
            collaboration is a two-way transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter what stage of life you are in, whether you’re just
            starting at a college or being promoted to CEO of a Fortune 500
            company, you have much to offer those who are trying to follow in
            your footsteps. A senior might have much to offer to a younger
            student just entering the freshman year , and a successful business
            owner will have a wealth of knowledge to offer a 1st year business
            student.
          </p>
          <p>
            As long as you are willing to share your knowledge and experience,
            you are always welcome to join the network. What’s more, your
            willingness to mentor encourages others to share their knowledge
            with you. That is what Evangadi is all about.
          </p>
          <h3>How can people join the network?</h3>
          <p>
            The network is being built on evangadi.com, and anyone can join. The
            website has a well-designed onboarding process to help you easily
            find your way as a newcomer. In addition to the website, we also
            have the following social media accounts to help you stay connected
            with everyone and address questions raised by members and newcomers
            alike:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <div><FaRegCheckCircle color="#8ad62b" size={25}/> Experts:</div>
                <p> These are the people who are
              considered to be the most knowledgeable in their field of
              expertise.</p>
              
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
              <FaRegCheckCircle color="#8ad62b" size={25}/>  Seniors:
              </div>
              <p>
                These are members who have a great deal of knowledge about the
                field, but they are not yet at the top.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                Juniors:
              </div>
              <p>
                These are the people who are already working in the field and
                have some knowledge, but they are still learning.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>

              </div>
              <p>
                These are newcomers to the field. These people are still trying
                to figure out where to start.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div className="units">
            <h6>Note: Members identify their own skill level upon joining the Groups.</h6>
            <h4>Units</h4>
            <p>Units are structured according to knowledge levels. Each Unit is composed of 5 mentees and 1 mentor.</p>
            <p>Experts mentor mid-level and below, mid-levels mentor juniors and below, juniors mentor complete beginners, and complete beginners mentor others in the way they are qualified (e.g. mentoring high school students).</p>
            <p>Every member can volunteer to become a mentor of a Unit.</p>
            <p>Only those who volunteer to be mentors themselves can get a mentor.</p>
            <p>If you opt out of being a mentor, you can still be a member of the group and participate on the surface level by asking questions or answering general questions on the group pages.</p>
            <hr />
          </div>
          <h3>What are the responsibilities of being a mentor?</h3>
          <p>Mentoring is completely voluntary and how much time you dedicate is 100% decided by you. When you become a mentor, you are asked to create a group chat for the members of your unit and answer their questions as much you can. We encourage lower members to help each other when possible, but the mentor should be there to offer assistance as much as possible.</p>
          <p>Think of your unit as your own class for which you get to write the syllabus. Write your own description and let your mentees know how much time you are planning to dedicate to the unit. Once you are done, your unit will be open for the public to join. Your contact info and link to the group chat will only be visible to those who actually join your unit on the website.</p>
          <p>Mentees can only join one Unit at a time within a group and need to leave one Unit before being able to join another. Although there is something to be learned from everyone in the network, we encourage you to join the Unit run by the most senior developer available, as they will have the most knowledge to share.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Can a mentor have multiple Units?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely, a mentor can have as many Units as they can handle. But remember, mentees can join or leave any unit they want, so if you spread yourself too thin and don’t give your mentees enough attention, they may leave your unit. At the same time, mentors have the power to kick mentees out of their units.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>How can mentees find a specific mentor’s Units?</h3>
          <p>All open Units will be listed under their respective groups along with the mentor's information and a description given by the mentor.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Is there a common area where all members of the group can communicate?</h3>
          <p>Yes, the main common areas are group-level pages where you can communicate with the rest of the members of the community. The specific social media links are shared on the group pages on our website.</p>
          <hr />
          <h1>Partners</h1>
          <h3>Who are the partners?</h3>
          <p>
These are educational institutions, organizations, and individuals who are collaborating with Evangadi to further assist our members with courses that can help members quickly advance to a higher skill level.</p>
          <p>Some provide these kinds of assistance for free, but most charge a reasonable amount for their courses. These partners will be listed on our website to help members find qualified instructors.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>How can I become a partner with Evangadi?</h3>
          <p>To become a partner, you need to have a well-designed course that we believe would be helpful to our members. We will do a thorough evaluation of your organization and offered courses and will accept your partnership request if we believe in the overall quality and value of what you have to offer. Once accepted, your company will be added to our partners list.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Does it cost me to become a partner?</h3>
          <p>There is no payment or profit sharing that we request from our partners. If we believe in what you do, we will gladly promote and recommend your service to members of our community for free. However, we will constantly consider feedback from our members to decide whether we should continue a partnership.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Does Evangadi play any role in designing or setting the prices for partner courses?</h3>
          <p>No! Partners design their own courses, decide their own prices, and run their own classes independently. We do not involve or interfere with how partners do their business. The only thing we do is recommend courses that we believe will benefit our members.</p>
